<p>I am a New York City based Product Designer who focuses on research-backed solutions for teams thinking about their future. Throughout my career, I have remained user-obsessed and eternally curious.</p>

<p>My current role within the Cloud Computing industry has provided me with a highly technical skillset. In addition to my comprehensive UX skills; I write HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python and understand how to design alongside developers. Here's my current <a href="https://stackshare.io/kplsn/my-stack" target="_blank">stack</a>.</p>

<p>I find inspiration in Bauhaus and Danish design, the mediterranean coast, brutalist architecture, and minimalism.</p>

<p>In my free time you can find me painting, writing code, or wandering through a museum.</p>
