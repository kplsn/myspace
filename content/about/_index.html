<p>I am a highly technical New York City based Product Designer who focuses on creative, research-backed solutions for teams thinking about the future. Throughout my career, I have remained user-obsessed and eternally curious.</p>

<p>My current role within the Cloud Hosting industry has provided me with a full life-cycle perspective on how products and teams can best work together.</p>

<p>I find inspiration in Bauhaus and Danish design, the mediterranean coast, brutalist architecture, and minimalism.</p>

<p>In my free time you can find me painting, writing code, or wandering through a museum.</p>
