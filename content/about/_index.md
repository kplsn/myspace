I am a New York City based Product Designer who focuses on creative, research-backed solutions for teams thinking about the future. Throughout my career, I have remained user-obsessed and eternally curious.

I find inspiration in Bauhaus and Danish design, the mediterranean coast, brutalist architecture, and minimalism.

In my free time you can find me painting, writing code, or wandering through a museum.
