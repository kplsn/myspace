My experience studying UX Design in a pandemic.
<!--more-->
---

In 2019 I enrolled in a User Experience Design course with General Assembly.

This course covered user research, wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing while assigning mini projects at each step. The projects were extremely helpful as I am a hands-on learner.

Finally, we covered visual and user interface design before beginning the final project to tie it all together.

## Why UX Design?

Growing up, I attended art-magnet schools and have always been drawn to the arts in every form. I knew that I wanted to work in a creative field, but also that I wanted to stay in tech. In 2019 I took a half dozen career quizzes online and every single one of them matched me with User Experience Design.

Then, like for many, the pandemic put a lot of things into perspective. 

During the quarantine I began painting again and taking supplementary design courses through Linkedin Learning, SuperHi and other programs.

Completing this course with General Assembly was an important foundation in my knowledge of design. I have focused on building my skills through real world practice and apprenticeships and I am confident that this is what I was meant to be doing in life. 

I feel engaged, fulfilled and inspired and so excited for what's ahead.

## Why General Assembly?

General Assembly had all-around excellent reviews, including many testimonial videos on Youtube that made it an easy choice. The syllabus provided realistic expectations on what I would be learning, and the topics appeared to be curated for our success.
