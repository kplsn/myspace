Grapevine was built to redefine how the travel industry engages with their customers.

I joined the Grapevine team for a few months in 2019 to lead their social media efforts. At the time, I had recently traveled to nearly 50 countries and was excited to work in a role so closely aligned with my passions.

> Grapevine is the Netflix of travel. 

I was tasked with providing specialized and original copy, photography and graphics. These were to be used across all social platforms, the website and in our paid advertisements.

I moderated user research sessions throughout the development cycle with a focus on our new influencer partnership program.

> Grapevine enables travel businesses to put personalised and local recommendations at the heart of your product offering.

## Outcome

I built our *Brand Partnership Program* based on both qualitative and quantitative user research. This allowed us to form relationships with relevant brands to offer giveaways, user perks and shared marketing strategies.

During one quarter, I managed to increase our social media engagement rates by an average of 33%. This meant that our content was performing at more than 3x the industry standard. Our customers were engaged and we began to foster brand loyalty.
