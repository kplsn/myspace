I was tasked with creating a Wall of Fame for our VP and Leadership team. 

This page will live in Confluence and should highlight specific customer comments left in regards to their support experience. I sourced these comments from our NPS scores and CSAT surveys using Looker.

As Confluence poses limitations, this page is a static image that will be routinely updated by the Support Team Leads. As our Support Team Leads do not currently have design experience, I was empowered to offer 1:1 mini Figma lessons so that they can feel confident in maintaining this page on their own.

Adding a photo icon for each user was a simple way to personalize the feedback
