A vintage Myspace twist on a traditional job application.

In 2020 I was applying for an internal role and needed a way to showcase my work. I was already very familiar with everyone on the team and thought they would also find this retro throwback to be fun.

I created this static Myspace page (era 2004) using Hugo, CSS and HTML and hosted it on DigitalOcean's AppPlatform. This was a fun project because it allowed the team to learn more about me, as well as highlight some of the internal projects I had recently worked on.

This project really brought back memories! Some of the HTML snippets (such as the "online" status) were sourced from old Myspace Layout sites.
