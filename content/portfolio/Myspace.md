A vintage Myspace twist on a traditional job application.

---
I needed a job application for an internal role, but knew that I wanted something that would stand out.

I created this Myspace page (era 2004) using Hugo, CSS and HTML and hosted it on DigitalOcean's AppPlatform. This was a fun project because it allowed the team to learn more about me, as well as highlight some of the internal projects I had recently worked on.

Writing the code brought back a ton of nostalgia; I even used popular Myspace Layout sites to add features such as glitter icons and the "online" status.
